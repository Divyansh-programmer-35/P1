This is a project which I made during my first year in college.
In this project you have 30 images of coins. No of coins differ from each image and in some images the no of coins are same but either the coin is different or the position of coin is different.
The program identifies the no of coin each image have and then sorts the image in ascending order.
It uses 3 sorting techniques-
    Quick Sort,
    Radix Sort,
    Bucket Sort
